This is the landing page of my personal websites.

This website is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
with the [Aerial](https://github.com/sethmacleod/aerial) theme, originally from
[HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/aerial).

## Build the website locally

To build and preview the website locally, you need to install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) first,
